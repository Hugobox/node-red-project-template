# node-red-project-template
This is a template for a Node-RED project meant to be run in local mode.  The idea is to run an instance of Node-RED entirely from within a local directory to make it more portable.  This also has the advantage of making running multiple instances of Node-RED at the same time easier.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/natcl/node-red-project-template.git
cd node-red-project-template
./start
```

When running multiple instances in parallel, you can specify a port:

```
./start 1885
```
